    <div>
        In Javascript you can pass functions as an argument to other functions to be called after the first function has executed. It’s called callback functions. <br>
        You especially use this when dealing with web requests since you don’t know exactly when you get the requested data and while you wait for it, you don’t want your whole app <br>
        to be blocked.<br>
        In using callback functions, we often turn to arrow functions, since they are shorter and simpler to write.
