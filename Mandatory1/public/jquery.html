        jQuery is a Javascript library which makes Javascript much easier to use. It uses the DOM like Javascript itself and also has AJAX. jQuery also handles all cross-platform issues. <br> 
        To use the library, you need to run a script. This script can be run locally, but it’s better to use someone else’s hosting of it since you’re then saved the trouble of sending the script with every request.<br>
        You can get the script from Google <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries#jquery">here</a>.<br>
        When using Google’s hosting, you’re sure to have faster loading of your web page, since Google’s servers are everywhere.<br>
        With jQuery you select html elements and do actions on them very easily. You select them with the $ sign and one or more selectors which can be for instance a class, id or type.<br>
        <br>
        Example of how it can look like:
        <br>
        <br>
        ${#button}.click(() => {<br>
        // code for what happens when you click on the element with the id of button<br>
        });<br>
        <br>
        You'll use jQuery when you handle different events on the page, for instance clicking a button or hover the mouse over something.
