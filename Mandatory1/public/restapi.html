    <div>
    A REST API is an API that follows certain rules for exchanging data which means that it is a uniform interface, a sort of contract. <br>
    First of all, data is in the form of json objects. To exchange objects, we use http methods like for instance get, post and delete. <br>
    Second of all, the resources’ URLs follow the same pattern with a www.example.com/collection/id-number so we know how to request the data. <br>
    This is called a path variable. We can also request data in a query string like this www.example.com/search?id=1&name=hello<br>
    Here we request a json object with an id of 1 and a name of hello.<br>
    As a client, we can use someone else’s API to get data for our own service or we can make our service into an API and allow other services to get our data.<br>
    The REST APIs are stateless in that they don’t store any client’s requests and thus a request must contain all information necessary to perform the request.<br>
