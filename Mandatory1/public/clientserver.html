        You often talk about clients and servers when talking about the internet. You can see client/server as a structure over information.<br>
        Clients are all our devices with access to the internet as phones, computers, tables and watches and such. <br>
        They want information, maybe to be able to see web pages in a client program like a browser. <br>
        They therefore send requests to a server computer that holds that information in a service app. <br>
        The server finds the information, which might be in the form of a html file, and sends that as a response to the client.<br>
