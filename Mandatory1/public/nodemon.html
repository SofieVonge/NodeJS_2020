<br>
    <div>
        Nodemon is a tool for Node and replaces the command <span style="color: red" >node</span> with <span style= "color: red">nodemon</span> when starting the app. 
        With nodemon you only need to start your app once and then it will restart the app every time there has been a change in the code. <br>
        This saves time and is handy for developing web apps where you want to see how your change has affected your page.<br>
        You would almost always need Nodemon for all your projects and therefore you should install it globally with the following command: <br>
        <p>npm install nodemon -g</p>
